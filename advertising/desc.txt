Motto: learn languages easily!

Anki Crossword generates crosswords from publicly accessible Anki Flashcard packages.

With the help of these flashcards you can study arbitrary things, first of all, words of languages. I learned 1800 english word in 3 weeks with the help of this app :)

All you have to do to achieve this, that you have to find a good package for your learned language, generate crosswords from it, and fill them many times.
